# Cubix - The AI Rubik's Cube Detector Model
 
## Tech stack
tensorflow
Javascript / python? 

## Model

The goal of this project is to train a model that can detect the colors of a Rubik's cube. The model will be trained on a dataset of images of Rubik's cubes. The model will be able to detect the colors of the Rubik's cube in real-time.

In order to do this we will train the model on a dataset of images of Rubik's cubes.

This project will explore which techniques are best for training a model to detect the colors of a Rubik's cube.


## How to photo Cubes for training 
- How many images should we need? 

- How to take the images?(background, lighting, angle, distance, etc.)

- What is the feature and label taht we provide ? 
- How to label the images?
- How to split the data into training and testing sets?
- How to augment the data?
